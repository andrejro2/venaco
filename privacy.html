        <h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>
 <p>       You may choose to give us personal information directly in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us your name and contact information to communicate with you, to order a product, to process an order, to register for a service, to provide you with a Newsletter subscription, or to do business with us if you are a supplier or a business partner. If you tell us that you do not want us to use your information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your request, we will respect your wishes.
        We may also collect information relating to your use of our web sites and cloud offerings through the use of various technologies. In addition, some of our software products include technologies that allow Venaco Group to collect certain information about product use. We may also use such technologies to determine whether you've opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail. Collecting information in this manner allows us to collect statistics about the usage and effectiveness of our web sites and our cloud offerings, personalise your experience and tailor our interactions with you. For details regarding the technologies we employ, see Cookies, Web Beacon and Other Technologies below.
        From time to time, we may also collect information that pertains to you indirectly through other sources, such as list vendors. When we do so, we ask the vendors to confirm that the information was legally acquired by the third party and that we have the right to obtain it from them and use it.
        The information that we collect, either directly or indirectly, may be combined to help us improve its overall accuracy and completeness and to help us better our services.

        <h4>Sharing of Personal Information and International Transfers</h4>
        <p>Venaco Group is a multi-national organisation with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share information about you within Venaco Group and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, Venaco Group will still handle your information in the manner described here.
        In some cases, Venaco Group uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyse, and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is Venaco Group's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Venaco Group’s policies.
        From time to time, we may disclose information that identifies you at an individual level and which we collected on our Web sites to other non-Venaco Group entities that are not acting as our suppliers, such as our business partners. Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we will only do so with your prior consent. We do not sell or lease such information however.
        Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Venaco Group decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is Venaco Group’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
        When transferring your information outside of the country of collection for the purposes identified above, Venaco Group complies with applicable law. For data originating from a European Union member state, Venaco Group uses a variety of data transfer mechanisms (including standard contractual clauses) for this purpose.
        Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of Venaco Group, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.

        <h4>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies</h4>
        <p>As mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our Web sites and your use of our cloud offerings and our software products to help us gather statistics about usage and effectiveness, personalise your experience, and tailor our interactions with you. We do so through the use of various technologies, including scripts, tags, Local Shared Objects (Flash cookies), Local Storage (HTML5) beacons, and one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer. While cookies are often only used to measure web site usage (such as number of visitors and duration of visit) and effectiveness (such as topics visitors are most interested in) and to allow for ease of navigation or use and, as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalise a known visitor's experience to a web site by being associated with profile information or user preferences. Over time this information provides valuable insight to help improve the user experience.
        Cookies are typically categorised as "session" cookies or "persistent" cookies. Session cookies help you navigate through the Web site efficiently, keeping track of your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information you have already provided during the current visit. Session cookies are stored in temporary memory and erased when the web browser is closed. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, store user preferences for current and successive visits. They are written on your device's hard disk, and are still valid when you restart your browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location.
        While Venaco Group web sites at this time do not recognise automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as "do not track" instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies though your web browser. Look under the heading "Tools" (or similar heading) in your particular browser for information about controlling cookies. You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies. Cookies in our software products can be turned off in the product itself. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web sites' features or features of our software products and SaaS offerings, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block, turn off or otherwise reject our cookies, some web pages may not display properly. Some Venaco Group web sites, cloud offerings and software products may also use web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Venaco Group’s web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages or use of these products, you can set your browser to turn off cookies or turn off cookies in the product itself, respectively. If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages; however, they will not be associated with information otherwise stored in cookies.
        For more information about the technologies employed by our cloud offerings and software products, including how to turn them off, please consult the user guide for the particular software product or cloud offering you are using.
        Some of our business partners set web beacons and cookies on our site. In addition, third-party social media buttons may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring Web site addresses, and, if you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link such collected information with your profile information on that site. We do not control these third-party tracking technologies.
